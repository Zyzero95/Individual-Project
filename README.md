# Individual-Project: Animal Facts

## Project Summary
The project is a website about Animal Facts. Where I use .Net to create a minimal API and use it on the FrontEnd website.

This project will be made with Next.js, React primarly and ASP .Net Core, EntityFramework for the BackEnd API.

The API has hard coded data that is used for the project.

## The features of the website:

## API
Getting images and data from a local API.

## Header
The header is pretty simple. It has a heading and a navigation bar for the Home,About and Random ID pages.

## Hero Slideshow
An image carousel where you can hover over the slideshow to stop it from transitioning.

## Home Page
The Home Page is where you will find most of the implemented features.

### Searchbar and Filterbar
Using searchParams and array sorting to change the array of data depending on what you are searching for.

### Animal Card
Includes an image, name and latin name, tags(environments where they are usually found) and a button navigating you to their respective ID page.

### Pagination
Shows 6 out of 60 total animal cards and creates a wat to navigate between them. There is also implemented logic for when search and filter is changing the array, calculating the correct amount of pages.

## Footer
A simple footer section that includes: link to my github repository, link to my LinkedIn profile and a Scroll to Top button.

A simple static page with some sample text.

## ID Page
Gives you more detailed information about a specific animal, it includes: image, name, environment, species, diet and a short description about the animal.
